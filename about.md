## What does it do? 
This project is a "Sales Tax Mapper" 🤑. Essentially it allows the user to click or enter somewhere in the world, and those coordinates (lat, lng) are sent through a geocoding service and turned into a zip code, which goes into a request to a public API called API Ninjas - Sales Tax and retrieves the sales tax data from that location. The fetched data is then displayed to the user on the web page.
## How do I use it? 🧐
Simply create a .env file with the API keys, save it, and run "npm run dev" in the terminal and go to the link it provides.
