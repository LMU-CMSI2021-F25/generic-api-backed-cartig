# AI Review ðŸ¤–
## Was AI used in this project?
Short answer: Yes. I used AI mainly to explain to me how to use more complex logic such as handling the "clear-search" button and how to properly embed HTML inside of the App.jsx file. 
## Questions asked to AI:
I asked Google Gemini 2.5 Pro a couple of questions: 1. How do I implement a clear-search button for a search bar in JavaScript? And what if this search bar corresponds to a mapbox? How do I ensure that the map zooming in and out is handled when the search is cleared? 2. How do I properly embed the HTML for a website I am developing into a .jsx file?
